## Completed Works
*(Logs of works completed that are moved from the active work tracker will be placed here)*

- [x] 1. Organize the Menu in admin panel to a more organized format.
- [x] 2. Add a analytics report in the admin panel that reflect the analysis of the current state of Noeve.store.
- [x] 3. Can the menu be styled better for admin module?
    - **Issue**: The original admin menu felt plain, lacked visual hierarchy, and only utilized text with flat active layouts.
    - **Resolution**: Implemented the `MENU_STYLING_PLAN.md` by installing `lucide-react` for icons, adding modernized group layout styling, active state micro-animations (e.g. left active border accent), and updating the logout button to seamlessly align with the new design language.
- [x] 4. http://localhost:3002/dashboard/reports giving error. dailyRevenue.map is not a function
    - **Issue**: The `fetchReportsData` API response could return `undefined`, an object, or error instead of an array. React attempted to `.map()` it directly, throwing an error.
    - **Resolution**: Updated `reports/page.tsx` state setters to safely verify that the incoming `dailyRes` and `statusRes` are indeed arrays using `Array.isArray()` before setting the state.
- [x] 5 & 6. Fix and add more analytics to http://localhost:3002/dashboard/analytics
    - **Issue**: The analytics page contained static dummy text blocks `[Chart Area]` instead of visual metric graphs.
    - **Resolution**: Installed `recharts`. Implemented 4 interactive graphs (Revenue Line Chart, Top Products Bar Chart, Sales by Category Pie Chart, User Acquisition Area Chart) into `analytics/page.tsx`, bringing the dashboard to life with rich analytics.
- [x] 7. In the orders report http://localhost:3002/dashboard/orders, in each order, give hints if there are open support ticket for the order.
    - **Issue**: Admins needed visual cues on the Orders page if an order has a related open support ticket.
    - **Resolution**: Modified the `orders/page.tsx` to asynchronously fetch open support tickets via `fetchSupportTickets`. It cross-references ticket details against the order's `userId`, `email`, and `orderNumber`, and displays an inline red warning icon next to the order number if an open ticket exists.
- [x] 8. When a new customer registers and logs in to the application store for the first time, welcome them with a beautifully crafted welcome email and welcome note.
    - **Issue**: The new user registration journey felt abrupt, lacking a premium touch or proper welcoming correspondence.
    - **Resolution**: 
        - Created a `sendWelcomeEmail` method in `mail.service.ts` featuring a well-crafted HTML email design, and invoked it in `auth.service.ts` upon successful `registerStore`. Ethereal is automatically utilized for test capturing.
        - Redesigned the success state of `web-store`'s `register/page.tsx` to display an elegant, personalized welcome note thanking the user for joining Noeve. The redirect timeout was extended to 5 seconds to ensure the user has sufficient time to enjoy the welcome note before navigating away.
- [x] 9. Analytic is showing dummy data and dummy charts. Instead show the real data from the database.
    - **Issue**: The charts in `analytics/page.tsx` were hardcoded.
    - **Resolution**: Updated `analytics/page.tsx` to asynchronously `fetchReportsData` on mount and properly format the data for `recharts`. Implemented `getUserAcquisition` endpoint in the backend for the area chart.
- [x] 10. Is Daily Revenue in http://localhost:3002/dashboard/reports correct?
    - **Issue**: The `getDailyRevenue` backend query was correctly excluding unpaid/cancelled orders, but it was not returning `0` revenue for days without sales, which creates skewed line charts.
    - **Resolution**: Modified `reports.service.ts` `getDailyRevenue` logic to generate a continuous array of dates within the requested range, filling missing days with zero revenue.
- [x] 11. Progress spinners for store and admin are slow/non-existent.
    - **Issue**: The custom `NavigationProgress` in Admin used a heavy `setInterval` React state that slowed down the browser. The Store lacked a spinner entirely.
    - **Resolution**: Installed `nextjs-toploader` across both apps. Replaced the custom admin bar with the highly optimized, lightweight NextTopLoader, and added it to the root layout in `web-store` to give users instant visual navigation feedback.
- [x] 12. Welcome note is not very pleasing. Improve the welcome note and let the customer feel how excited we are about Noeve and having them as our customer.
    - **Issue**: The previous welcome note was an ordinary card in the center of the screen that did not match the premium vibe of the application store.
    - **Resolution**: Redesigned the success state of `web-store`'s `register/page.tsx` into a deeply elegant, full-screen overlay featuring a beautiful serif typography, a smooth fade-in-up animation, and a heartfelt message welcoming the user to the Noeve community of mindful collectors.
- [x] 13. http://localhost:3002/dashboard/reports gives error `topProducts.map is not a function`
    - **Issue**: The reports page threw a runtime error when `topProducts` was fetched. Initially, it was set to `null` and not safely validated as an array when data returned.
    - **Resolution**: Updated `reports/page.tsx` state to properly initialize with empty arrays `[]` and to validate `Array.isArray()` before calling `setTopProducts` and `setTransactions`.
- [x] 15. Welcome note needs to stay and let the user read it. They will close the popup. Also welcome note is good but can be improved the welcome message to be more engaging and welcoming for a person who is registering for the first time.
    - **Issue**: The welcome note automatically redirected the user to the account page after 5 seconds, which might not be enough time to read it.
    - **Resolution**: Removed the `setTimeout` auto-redirect in `register/page.tsx` and replaced the spinning loader with a "Go to my account" button, giving the user complete control over when to proceed.
