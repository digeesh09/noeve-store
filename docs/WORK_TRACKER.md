## Overall progress (as of 2026-06-26)

| Phase | Scope | Status | Estimate |
|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| **MVP** | API + web-store + web-admin: catalog, cart, checkout, orders, manual fulfillment | ✅ **Done** | 100% |
| **Phase 2** | mobile-store polish, live payments, email notifications | **In progress** | ~85% |
| **Phase 3** | mobile-admin scanning, push tracking, promotions | **Not started** | ~5% |
| **Phase 4** | Search, analytics, multi-warehouse, loyalty | **Not started** | 0% |
| **Phase 5** | Enterprise & B2B: Mega menu, blogs, custom modules, B2B quotes, advanced workflows | **Not started** | 0% |

**Where we stopped:** Stabilized the Admin Catalog and Web Store features. Resolved image upload path errors, added API static file serving, fixed dynamic image rendering and zoom magnifier on the Web Store product details page. Standardized admin pricing forms to use standard currency rather than raw cents for consistency, aligned shipping thresholds, and wired dynamic session checking to the site header.
