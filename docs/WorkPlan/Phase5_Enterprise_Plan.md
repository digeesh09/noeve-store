# Phase 5: Enterprise & B2B (Storefront & Checkout)

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation strategy for the final phase of the Noeve project. The goal is to elevate the storefront to an enterprise-grade experience by introducing robust content management, advanced navigation, dynamic filtering, and a comprehensive customer portal.

## Task Breakdown & Implementation Strategy

### 1. Task 37: Advanced Navigation (Mega Menu)
**Goal:** Implement a Mega Menu for complex category structures.
**Details:**
- **Component (`apps/web-store/src/components/layout/mega-menu.tsx`):**
  - Create a hover-activated dropdown that spans the width of the container.
  - Implement dynamic category fetching from the backend (or statically generated).
  - Include featured product images or banners within the menu itself to drive engagement.
- **Integration:** Update the `site-header.tsx` to utilize this new navigation structure, ensuring mobile responsiveness (e.g., converting to an accordion menu on small screens).

### 2. Task 38: Content Management (Blogs module)
**Goal:** Develop a Blogs module for rich content.
**Details:**
- **Database Schema:** Extend Prisma schema to include `Post` and `Category` entities (title, slug, content, author, publishedAt).
- **Admin UI (`apps/web-admin/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/content`):**
  - Build a rich text editor (e.g., using Tiptap or similar) for creating and updating blog posts.
- **Storefront UI (`apps/web-store/src/app/blog`):**
  - Create a blog index page `/blog` and a dynamic route `/blog/[slug]` to display articles.

### 3. Task 39: Product Interactions (Reviews & Filters)
**Goal:** Implement Product Reviews and Advanced Product Filters (faceted search).
**Details:**
- **Product Reviews:**
  - Enhance the `Review` model if necessary.
  - Add a review submission form on the storefront product page (`/shop/[slug]`).
  - Update admin dashboard to moderate reviews before they go public.
- **Faceted Search (`/shop`):**
  - Modify the `ShopPage` to include a sidebar for filtering by price range, attributes (e.g., size, color), and categories.
  - Ensure the URL updates dynamically (e.g., `?category=apparel&price=0-100`) to support shareable links and SEO.

### 4. Task 40: Customer Portal
**Goal:** Enhance self-service capabilities for customers.
**Details:**
- **My Account (`apps/web-store/src/app/account`):**
  - Add an order history view with detailed status tracking (integrating the shipment data).
  - Add an address book manager (CRUD operations for addresses).
  - Implement a simple mechanism for initiating returns or support requests directly from an order.

## Next Steps
This plan covers the final steps in the active tracker. If approved, we will begin sequentially, starting with the **Advanced Navigation (Mega Menu)** in the Web Store.
