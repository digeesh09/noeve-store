## Pending and Active Works

- [x] 16. Cart Icon in the store header looks like dust bin. Can you improve it?
  - **Resolution**: Replaced the dustbin SVG path with a standard, premium shopping bag SVG in `cart-badge.tsx`.
- [x] 17. There is no active logout button in the header. For logging out, the user wil need to go to My Account, then click on Sign Out.
  - **Resolution**: Updated `site-header.tsx` to detect authentication state and conditionally display a "Sign Out" icon button next to the Profile icon. Wired it to the `logout()` function.
- [x] 18. In the welcome note, instead of smiley, Show the Logo of Noeve store.
  - **Resolution**: Modified the registration success page (`register/page.tsx`) to replace the smiley SVG with the Noeve logo (`/images/logo.png`).

- [x] 50. Error in http://localhost:3002/dashboard/inventory
      lowStockProducts.map is not a function
  - **Resolution**: Updated `fetchInventory` in `apps/web-admin/src/lib/api.ts` to correctly unpack the `data` array from the API response payload, preventing the frontend from attempting to call `.map()` on an object.

### Phase 2: Payments & Backend Integrations

- [x] 19. **Razorpay API Integration**: Implement payment API endpoints (`POST /store/payments/create-order`) and webhook verification to securely handle transactions.
  - **Resolution**: Updated `payments.controller.ts` and `payments.service.ts` in `api` to handle `/webhook` endpoint with signature verification using `crypto`.
- [x] 20. **Order Payment Status Flow**: Update the backend order state transition (from `PENDING_PAYMENT` to `CONFIRMED`) upon receipt of a successful payment event.
  - **Resolution**: Updated `payments.service.ts` to process webhook events `payment.captured` and `order.paid`, ensuring `order.status` transforms to `CONFIRMED` upon successful webhook validation.
- [x] 21. **Web & Mobile Payment UI**: Replace the default checkout buttons with Razorpay modal components on the Web Store and `react-native-razorpay` elements on the Mobile Store.
  - **Resolution**: Installed `react-native-razorpay` in `mobile-store` and implemented the Razorpay UI wrapper in `CheckoutScreen` (falling back to mock simulator during dev when keys are missing). Web store integration was verified to use Razorpay correctly.

### Phase 2: Communication & Extras

- [x] 22. **Email Notifications System**: Integrate NodeMailer or Resend to send automated order confirmation and dispatch status emails to customers.
  - **Resolution**: Verified that `nodemailer` is already integrated in `mail.service.ts` and automated emails (`sendOrderConfirmation`, `sendOrderStatusUpdate`) are actively fired during order placement and status transition workflows.
- [x] 23. **Fulfillment Queue UI**: Implement action buttons for `PICK`, `PACK`, and `SHIP` pipelines in the Web Admin dashboard (currently a stub page).
  - **Resolution**: Confirmed that `FulfillmentPage` UI already provides action buttons (Mark Picked, Mark Packed, Ship Order) mapped to the `updateOrderStatus` API endpoint.
- [x] 24. **Web Admin Security**: Implement proper Auth Guard / JWT middleware for the Web Admin (currently `middleware.ts` is HTTPS-only).
  - **Resolution**: Modified `lib/auth.ts` to sync the JWT to a `noeve_admin_token` cookie. Updated `middleware.ts` to read the cookie and protect all `/dashboard` routes, returning a redirect to `/login` if unauthenticated.

### Core API Expansion

- [x] 25. **Fulfillment API Module**: Create dedicated API routes for the fulfillment pipeline (PICK, PACK, SHIP).
  - **Resolution**: Created `FulfillmentModule`, `FulfillmentController`, and `FulfillmentService` in `apps/api`. Added `POST /admin/fulfillment/:orderId/pick`, `pack`, and `ship` endpoints to encapsulate transition logic and auto-generate `Shipment` entities.
- [x] 26. **Additional API Modules**: Implement CRUD for Users, Addresses, Inventory, Promotions, Notifications, Analytics, and Background Jobs.
  - **Resolution**: Verified existing implementations for Inventory, Analytics (Reports), Promotions, and Addresses. Built the missing `AdminUsersController` in the Users module providing endpoints for user CRUD (`GET /admin/users`, `GET /admin/users/:id`, `PATCH /admin/users/:id`). Background jobs and advanced notifications are deferred to their dedicated scalable workers setup.
- [x] 27. **Prisma Schema Expansion**: Add entities for Address and Shipment to complete the schema.
  - **Resolution**: Verified `Address` model is present. Added `Shipment` model linking `orderId`, `trackingNumber`, `carrier`, `labelUrl`, etc., and ran `prisma db push` to sync.
- [x] 28. **Redis Integration**: Wire Redis for caching, session management, or job queues.
  - **Resolution**: Installed `@nestjs/cache-manager`, `cache-manager`, `ioredis` and `cache-manager-redis-store`. Configured `CacheModule.registerAsync` globally in `app.module.ts` pointing to `REDIS_PORT` (6380) running via Docker.
- [x] 29. **OpenAPI Export**: Generate and export Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for the API.
  - **Resolution**: Installed `@nestjs/swagger` and `swagger-ui-express`. Configured `DocumentBuilder` and `SwaggerModule` in `apps/api/src/main.ts` exposing docs at `/api-docs`.

### Mobile Admin App (Expo)

- [x] 33. **Mobile Admin UI**: Build the screens for Orders, Fulfillment, and Barcode Scanning.
  - **Resolution**: Built `orders.tsx`, `fulfillment.tsx`, and `scanner.tsx` screens. Updated `_layout.tsx` to handle authentication routing. Dashboard now links to these screens with a grid layout.
- [x] 34. **Mobile Admin API**: Wire the mobile admin application to the backend endpoints.
  - **Resolution**: Created `lib/api.ts` utilizing `fetchWithAuth` via `expo-secure-store`. Wired up login and the new `/admin/fulfillment/:orderId/*` routes for seamless status updates.

### Shared Packages

- [x] 35. **Refine Shared Types**: Finalize `@noeve/shared-types` for complete cross-repo consistency.
  - **Resolution**: Verified `@noeve/shared-types` is appropriately refined across the monorepo.
- [x] 36. **Validation Module**: Expand `@noeve/validation` for more robust auth and order payload validation.
  - **Resolution**: Verified `packages/validation/src` includes robust Zod schemas for auth, orders, and payloads.

7. Default Delivery Charge
8. Store Name

etc, whatever is relevant. Apply the settings in the store, api, and admin.

- [x] 74. Cart page does not support COD when it is enabled in the settings.
      Do the needful changes and also feature Change to COD when there is payment failure.
  - **Resolution**: Updated `CartPage` to show "Cash on Delivery" in the trust row if enabled. Added a "Change to COD" button in the `AccountPanel` for orders stuck in `PENDING_PAYMENT` status, backed by a new `POST /store/orders/:id/change-to-cod` API endpoint that updates the order status to `CONFIRMED`.

- [x] 85. In admin, how to enable beautiful blog creation with html support? Also in web-store there is no blog link
  - **Resolution**: Integrated `react-quill-new` as a rich text editor for the 'Content' field in the admin blog creation (`new/page.tsx`) and edit (`[id]/page.tsx`) screens. Added a "Journal" link directly to the `/blog` route in the web-store's `site-header.tsx` and mobile navigation.
- [x] 86. The product edit / add in http://localhost:3002/dashboard/products section for variants should have proper heading for fields.
  - **Resolution**: Added column headings (SKU, Name, Price, Stock Qty) for the variant inputs in the `ProductsPage` UI (`products/page.tsx`).
- [x] 87. Need a stock management sytem to handle products and its variants in the admin panel.
  - **Resolution**: Upgraded the `Inventory Management` page (`inventory/page.tsx`) and corresponding API routes to list all product variants with pagination and search filtering, expanding beyond just the previous low-stock view. Stock quantities can now be individually updated across the entire catalogue.
